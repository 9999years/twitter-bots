A repo for my terrible twitter bots! Each bot is in a directory of its handle,
i.e. [@gardensbot] is in the `gardens` directory.

# Requirements

Generally, PHP7 with Curl and mbstring. But I wouldn’t be surprised if these
were moved to Python in the future...

# License

AGPLv3 for now, but I’d like to move to a non-profit license in the future.
